**Image Caption Generator üñºÔ∏èüí¨**

This repository contains a Python implementation of an image caption generator. The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which consists of 8,000 images with 5 captions each. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the image, and then a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate a caption based on the extracted features.

To use the image caption generator, simply clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the following command to generate a caption for an image:

```
python image_caption_generator.py -i <image_path>
```

The `<image_path>` argument is the path to the image file that you want to generate a caption for.

For example, to generate a caption for the image file `image.jpg`, you would run the following command:

```
python image_caption_generator.py -i image.jpg
```

The model will then generate a caption for the image and print it to the console.

You can also use the image caption generator to generate captions for multiple images at once. To do this, simply pass a list of image paths to the `-i` argument.

For example, to generate captions for the image files `image1.jpg` and `image2.jpg`, you would run the following command:

```
python image_caption_generator.py -i image1.jpg image2.jpg
```

The model will then generate captions for both images and print them to the console.

**Example Output**

```
Image Path: image.jpg
Caption: A cat sitting on a couch. üêàüõãÔ∏è
```

**Usage Tips**

* The image caption generator is still under development, so the generated captions may not always be accurate. However, the model is able to generate realistic and descriptive captions for a wide variety of images. üì∏
* The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which consists of a wide variety of images. However, the model may not be able to generate accurate captions for images that are very different from the images in the training dataset. ‚ö†Ô∏è
* If you are using the image caption generator to generate captions for multiple images at once, the model may take longer to generate captions. ‚è≥
