# Image Caption Generator using CNN-RNN with Xception Model

## Overview

This project implements an image caption generator using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the Xception model as the backbone. It generates descriptive captions for images, allowing computers to understand and describe visual content.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Basim03/Image-caption-generator.git
   cd image-caption-generator
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and preprocess the dataset (See [Dataset](#dataset) section).

## Usage

### Training

To train the image caption generator, use the following command:

```
python train.py
```

This will train the model using the specified dataset and save the trained model weights.

### Inference

To generate captions for images using the trained model, use the following command:

```
python generate_caption.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```

Replace `path/to/image.jpg` with the path to the image for which you want to generate a caption.

# The Dataset of Python based Project

For the image caption generator, we will be using the Flickr_8K dataset. There are also other big datasets like Flickr_30K and MSCOCO dataset but it can take weeks just to train the network so we will be using a small Flickr8k dataset. The advantage of a huge dataset is that we can build better models.

Thanks to Jason Brownlee for providing a direct link to download the dataset (Size: 1GB).

-->[Flickr_8k_text](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_text.zip)

The Flickr_8k_text folder contains file Flickr8k.token which is the main file of our dataset that contains image name and their respective captions separated by newline(“\n”).

## Training

- The model architecture is based on the Xception model for feature extraction and an RNN (LSTM or GRU) for generating captions.
- You can configure training hyperparameters in `config.py`.
- Training data is loaded and preprocessed using the data pipeline defined in `data_loader.py`.
- The model is trained using the `train.py` script.

## Inference

- Inference is performed using the `generate_caption.py` script.
- Provide the path to an image, and the model will generate a descriptive caption for it.
- You can modify the model architecture and weights as needed for inference.

## Results

Describe the performance of your model, provide sample image-caption pairs, and any other relevant information about the results of your project.
